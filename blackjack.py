# To do :
# -Create a list to store the suit, rank, and point value for each card

# -Use a list of lists to store the cards in the deck. You can use two nested loops to create the deck of cards

# -Use a list of lists to store the dealer's hand and the player's hand

# -When the program starts, it should read the player's money amount from a CSV/txt file named money.txt'

# -The program should write the player's money amount to a file any time the data is changed'

# -Store the functions for writing and reading the moneu amount in a separate module named db.py

# -Handle the exception that occurs if the player can't find the data file

# -Handle the exceptions that occur if the user enters a string where an integer or float value is expected

# -The program should validate the bet amount.
# >>> The minimum bet should be 5
# >>> The maximum bet should be 1,000
# >>> The bet can't be bigger than the player's current amount of money.

# -If the money amount drops below the minimum bet(5), the program should give the player the option to buy more chips.
